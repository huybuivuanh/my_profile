        Hello! I'm Huy, currently in my fourth year of Computer Science at the
        University of Saskatchewan. I have a strong passion for developing
        mobile and web applications, and I enjoy bringing innovative ideas to
        life through technology. I completed high school and received my diploma
        from St. Mary High School in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. I started
        university in 2021 and have enjoyed learning programming here.
        Throughout the years, I've developed a wide range of technical and soft
        skills. I'm currently seeking an internship to enhance my skills and
        gain work experience.<br></br>
        <br></br>I moved to Canada from Vietnam in 2013, beginning my studies
        here in grade 6. My passion for math and physics developed early on,
        complemented by a love for music. After graduating high school in 2020,
        I decided to take a gap year to work and save money for university.
        During this time, I worked at my parents' restaurant in Prince Albert.
        This experience not only helped me financially but also taught me
        valuable lessons in responsibility and hard work. In 2021, I began my
        university journey, eager to explore the fields of mobile and web app
        development.
