        Hello! I'm Huy, currently in my fourth year of Computer Science at the
        University of Saskatchewan. I have a strong passion for developing
        mobile and web applications, and I enjoy bringing innovative ideas to
        life through technology. I completed high school and received my diploma
        from St. Mary High School in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. I started
        university in 2021 and have enjoyed learning programming here.
        Throughout the years, I've developed a wide range of technical and soft
        skills. I'm currently seeking an internship to enhance my skills and
        gain work experience before graduating.
